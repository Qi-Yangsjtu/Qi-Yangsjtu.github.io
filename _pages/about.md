<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 2nd-year Master student of [Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center (CMIC)](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Yiling Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=638kRwkAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree from SJTU, ranking top 20\%.

My research interests lie in media perceptual quality assessment (e.g., 3D point cloud, image, video) and low-level vision. Specifically, I focus on learning-based no-reference point cloud quality assessment.

I am actively seeking opportunities as a research intern and PhD at 25Fall or 25 Spring, please feel free to contact me!!!
